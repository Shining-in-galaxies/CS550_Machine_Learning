We specify a ``validation_fraction``\n","which denotes the fraction of the whole dataset that will be kept aside from\n","training to assess the validation loss of the model. The gradient boosting\n","model is trained using the training set and evaluated using the validation set.\n","When each additional stage of regression tree is added, the validation set is\n","used to score the model.  This is continued until the scores of the model in\n","the last ``n_iter_no_change`` stages do not improve by atleast `tol`. After\n","that the model is considered to have converged and further addition of stages\n","is \"stopped early\".\n","\n","The number of stages of the final model is available at the attribute\n","``n_estimators_``.\n","\n","This example illustrates how the early stopping can used in the\n",":class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` model to achieve\n","almost the same accuracy as compared to a model built without early stopping\n","using many fewer estimators.
